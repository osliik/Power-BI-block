```
SELECT o.user_id
FROM orders o

JOIN products p ON ol.product_id = p.product_id
WHERE o.order_date BETWEEN '2022-08-01' AND '2022-08-15'
  AND p.category = 'Animal Feed'

```

FROM orders o
JOIN order_lines ol ON o.order_id = ol.order_id
JOIN products p ON ol.product_id = p.product_id
JOIN warehouses w ON o.warehouse_id = w.warehouse_id
WHERE o.order_date BETWEEN '2022-08-15' AND '2022-08-30'
